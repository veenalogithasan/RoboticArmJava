# RoboticArmJava
Robotic Arm Capstone Project - Java

This Software Application will be able to send orientation angles (pitch, roll and yaw) to a blueNRG-2 MCU (via Bluetooth).
From these angles, the robotic arm will move to the desired pose. 

With this, the application can also return the robotic arm to a neutral position by sending rotation angles of 0,0,0 to
the MCU.

This app will also be able to recieve the true orientation angles from the MCU.
